seed README


Every year in china, the little home town i live in, when it comes to spring, the day time gets longer and more important, it gets warmer. 
Leaves and plants gets their life again abd comes out. Just the same in every corner of china, the seed finally turn into harvest of happiness and satisfaction. 
Years ago, i am just one really *stupid* young boy majoring in 通信工程 in chinese, never mind, you would not want to or need to know that word in chinese. One thing i learned in college and the only thing i learned is this : you are the only who takes responsibility for your life, and at the same time you are free to make choices, and the one matters, find what you like or love, then just do it.
This is the thing i have learned these four years, thks to nanjing, i like 紫荆山 there and people there, although i still can not figure out 南京话. so interesting.
So the first time i get to know programming, i fall in love with it, and never fall in love with others since than, including girls. And in programming, i am free to think and act, create things never exist before which is awesome.
And i did create some little toolkit and toys which have brought so much fun to me. 
But this project is some how different abd special. The winter comes, and i have to think about girls and money, well, so realise and urgent in my age here. So this.is what the project for, it is just like one seed, i put it here today, and someday, someday not very far from here today, i will come ba,k, and seed will turns.into trees and plants. thats the time of spring. 
well next words are all in chinese, and i will always keep them in mind. 
我们在冬天种下种子，也种下我们内心简单而善良的愿望，因为我们相信在不久到来的春天，这颗柔弱但是坚强的种子可以长大，开出美丽的花来。
是的，又一个春天已经在我心里面种下，我已看到春天温暖迷人的景色。
而我带着这样的景色，走进风雪，也终将穿越风雪。
